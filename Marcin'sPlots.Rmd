_In order not to be bothered with rounding the numbers, set 
`options(digits=3)` `r #options(digits=3)`._

## Exercise 5
**a)**
To investigate potential points and find any collinearity in our explanatory variables we take a look at plots between all the pairs of explanatory variables.
``` {r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6, collapse = TRUE}
library(knitr)
genreMeansData = read.table("output/genres_mean_ratings.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
plot(genreMeansData)
kable(genreMeansData)
```
